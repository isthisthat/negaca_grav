### ➡ New [class](#classes): Adult Beginners from 6th April 2017 until 8th June 2017!
Are you looking for a fun way to get fit? Do you want to re-connect with your inner child and re-learn to move to like one? Come and try our adult's beginner class! No previous experience necessary, just enthusiasm and willingness to try something freash.

Please book your place or ask questions [here](mailto:negaca@capoeiracambridge.co.uk). We train on Thursdays at 6:30pm at the Scout Hall (see [Schedule Section](#classes) for details). Axé.
